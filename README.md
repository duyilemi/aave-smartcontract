# aave-smartcontract

A smart-contract designed to interact with a decentralized lending protocol-AAVE.

# Overview

Approve our ETH to be swapped for WETH

Swap an amount of ETH for WETH on AAVE

We deposit the WETH as collateral

We use that collateral to borrow DAI or other assets

Then, we pay it back!

We can view the transaction on etherscan to see what's going on under the hood.
